## Rules
Minesweeper is a game where you clear a grid of hidden mines by using numerical clues to find all the safe squares. Here's how to play:

Objective: Open all safe squares without detonating any mines.

Starting the Game:

First choose a difficulty, the difault grid doesnÂ´t work and give you an error.
The first click is always safe and will never get a mine.
Click randomly until you uncover a large area with several numbers.
Gameplay:

Opening Squares: Use the left mouse button to open squares.
Flagging Mines: Use the right mouse button to place a flag on suspected mines.
Number Clues: Safe squares have numbers indicating how many mines are adjacent to them.
Empty Squares: If an opened square does not touch any mines, it will be empty, and adjacent squares will automatically open until numbers are reached.

Difficulty Levels:

Easy: 3x3 grid with 1 mines.
Intermediate: 9x9 grid with 6 mines.
Expert: 16x16 grid with 40 mines.
Winning and Losing:

Winning: Open all safe squares.
Losing: Click on a mine.


## Hints:

After opening the first Field  it should look like this:
![start](src/main/resources/pic1.png)

After selecting an other free Field:
![open](src/main/resources/pic2.png)

Here you can see that in this area it should be 1 Bomb: <br />
![one_Field](src/main/resources/pic3.png)

In this Area it indicates there are 2 Bombs: <br />
